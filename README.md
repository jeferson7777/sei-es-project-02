This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- Un par de párrafos sobre el enfoque general que tomaste:

We look for the api with less authorizations required. At the same time,
 we do a master code to apply the simplest way to do an MVP. We start testing
 VEL api but it is unstable. To continue We test Reedit, Spotify and many more.
No one of the main api can give us results. Only our original idea to do
an MVP with the simplest api drive us to songsterr api (list of songs of each
music band) left us to develop our final project by the original master code.


-Installation instructions for any dependencies:

To use proyect-base-react we start the installation cloning the project-base-react to our master branch. To continue we can install yarn by a terminal (like Hyper) writing: yarn (on the route of proyect-base-react). The last step It is writing again on the terminal 
and the website renders: yarn start.

- Descripciones de problemas sin resolver o obstáculos importantes que tu equipo tuvo que superar:

We found several handicaps at each test we do to at the differents 
api we try to run. Even our master code it was very hard to write to 
us because we don't know how to create a inner searcher or
 how to use async functions properly.








## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
